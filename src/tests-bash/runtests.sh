# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#    Discovery of JAXB implementation
#
#    When one of the newInstance methods is called, a JAXB implementation is discovered by the following steps.
#
#    1) For each package/class explicitly passed in to the newInstance(java.lang.String) method, in the order they are specified, jaxb.properties file is looked up in its package, by using the associated classloader â€” this is the owner class loader for a Class argument, and for a package the specified ClassLoader.
#    If such a file is discovered, it is loaded as a property file, and the value of the JAXB_CONTEXT_FACTORY key will be assumed to be the provider factory class. This class is then loaded by the associated classloader discussed above.
#
#    This phase of the look up allows some packages to force the use of a certain JAXB implementation. (For example, perhaps the schema compiler has generated some vendor extension in the code.)
#
#    2) If the system property JAXB_CONTEXT_FACTORY exists, then its value is assumed to be the provider factory class. This phase of the look up enables per-JVM override of the JAXB implementation.
#    3) Look for /META-INF/services/javax.xml.bind.JAXBContext file in the associated classloader. This file follows the standard service descriptor convention, and if such a file exists, its content is assumed to be the provider factory class. This phase of the look up is for automatic discovery. It allows users to just put a JAXB implementation in a classpath and use it without any furhter configuration.
#    4) Finally, if all the steps above fail, then the rest of the look up is unspecified. That said, the recommended behavior is to simply look for some hard-coded platform default JAXB implementation. This phase of the look up is so that JavaSE can have its own JAXB implementation as the last resort.
#    Once the provider factory class is discovered, its public static JAXBContext createContext(String,ClassLoader,Map) method (see newInstance(String, ClassLoader, Map) for the parameter semantics.) or public static JAXBContext createContet(Class[],Map) method (see newInstance(Class[], Map) for the parameter semantics) are invoked to create a JAXBContext.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# in short:
#
# 1) jaxb.properties in context package(s) - keyd by JAXB_CONTEXT_FACTORY
# 2) SystemProperty: JAXB_CONTEXT_FACTORY
#  * OSGi (non-SPEC)
# 3) ServiceLoader: /META-INF/services/javax.xml.bind.JAXBContext
# 4) default provider


#    testcases:
#
#        1) property file: ok
#        2) property file: missing property
#        3) property file: non-existing class property
#        4) property file: invalid class property
#
#        # system property: javax.xml.bind.context.factory
#        5) system property: ok
#        6) system property: ClassNotFound
#        7) system property: incorrect class

#        # ServiceLoader:
#        8) ok
#        9) ok - no new line
#        10) ClassNotFound
#        11) incorrect class
#
#        # default
#        12) no setup
#
#        # priorities:
#        13) prop.file sys.property ServiceLoader > prop.file
#        14) - sys.property + ServiceLoader > sys.prop
#        15) - - ServiceLoader > ServiceLoader
